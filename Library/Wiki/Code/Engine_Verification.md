# Engine Verification

The QuickCheck engine is the "Oracle" of our Antifragile system. To trust our libraries, we must first trust the engine that verifies them. In this chapter, we perform a series of sanity checks on the core QuickCheck machinery.

```idris
module Code.Engine_Verification

import QuickCheck
import Data.List
import Data.So

%default total
```

## 1. Successful Properties

A robust testing engine must be able to verify tautologies. We test two fundamental properties of Integers and Lists.

### Integer Commutativity
Addition of Integers is commutative. QuickCheck should pass this after 100 tests.

```idris
prop_addCommutative : Property
prop_addCommutative = forAll {a = (Int, Int)} {prop = Bool} arbitrary (MkFn (\(a, b) =>
  a + b == b + a))
```

### List Double Reversal
Reversing a list twice should return the original list.

```idris
prop_listDoubleReverse : Property
prop_listDoubleReverse = forAll {a = List Int} {prop = Bool} arbitrary (MkFn (\xs =>
  reverse (reverse xs) == xs))
```

## 2. Detecting Failures

An even more critical capability is the detection of counterexamples. We provide a property that we *know* is false.

### List Append Commutativity (False)
Appending lists is NOT commutative (e.g., `[1] ++ [2] != [2] ++ [1]`). QuickCheck should detect this and provide a counterexample.

```idris
prop_listAppendCommutative : Property
prop_listAppendCommutative = forAll {a = (List Int, List Int)} {prop = Bool} arbitrary (MkFn (\(xs, ys) =>
  xs ++ ys == ys ++ xs))
```

## 3. Verification Execution

We run these tests and observe the engine's output. For the false property, we expect to see a "Falsifiable" message with the offending arguments.

```idris
public export
main : IO ()
main = do
  let res1 = QuickCheck.quickCheck prop_addCommutative
  putStrLn $ "prop_addCommutative: " ++ res1.msg
  
  let res2 = QuickCheck.quickCheck prop_listDoubleReverse
  putStrLn $ "prop_listDoubleReverse: " ++ res2.msg
  
  let res3 = QuickCheck.quickCheck prop_listAppendCommutative
  putStrLn $ "prop_listAppendCommutative: " ++ 
    (if isJust res3.pass && fromMaybe True res3.pass then "FAILED (Should have failed)" else "OK (Correctly detected failure)")
```
