# Linear Physics Verification Matrix

This matrix tracks the automated testing suite for the core Cosmology, Chromogeometry, and Linear Memory Bridge modules.

### Core Concepts
* **`UniverseState`**: The purely functional mathematical data structure that models the universe. It contains the `Substrate` (a directed acyclic graph of causal evolution) and the `SparseMaxel` (the multiset of discrete spatial coordinates and spread polynomials).
* **Linear Bridge**: The module that strictly wraps the `UniverseState` in Idris 2's Linear Types (`1`). This enforces at compile-time that physical states can never be duplicated (No-Cloning Theorem) or accidentally destroyed (Conservation of Energy).
* **QuickCheck Properties**: Property-based testing. Instead of testing one specific state, QuickCheck procedurally generates hundreds of randomized `UniverseState` topologies and ensures the absolute physical laws hold true for *all* of them.

| Test | Description | Status | Details |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Label Extraction | Verifies that UniverseState can be serialized to a non-empty string label for topological graphing. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Strict Causality | Ensures that the directed causal graph (Substrate) maintains strictly monotonic time ordering with no cycles. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Injected Baryogenesis Epoch | Validates that skipping the vacuum and starting exactly at Phase 2 dynamically unfolds the Primorial 137-Grid, leading to the Baryogenesis phase transition (MatterGate). | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Eddington Scaling Bound | Confirms the polynomial scaling limits align with the Eddington Number (~10^81) within the target epochs (e.g. 38 scales). | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Not 138 Constraint | Verifies that the expansion dynamics break down / decohere irrevocably if pushed to a 138-grid. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Water Archimedes Signature | Dynamically verifies that the fundamental H₂O bond geometry perfectly balances Red and Blue quadrances, yielding an invariant structural anchor. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Methane Causal Stability | Proves that Methane's Red Quadrance signature precisely sums to a Null Vector, confirming perfectly balanced dynamic oscillation across its 4 bonds. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Carbon Valence Identity | Ensures Carbon's algebraic valence mathematically equals the BondGate degree (4), formalizing why it acts as the universal organic backbone. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Iron Structural Lag | Verifies the total structural Leibniz lag of Iron matches its nucleosynthesis peak state of 52 lag units. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Feynmanium Structural Lag | Verifies the maximum stable element Feynmanium possesses exactly 274 total lag units at the grid boundary. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Ascension Mass Conservation | Verifies that when a state condenses into a single macro-node during topological ascension, its total mass (Leibniz Lag) is perfectly conserved. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
| Empty Vacuum Anchor | Ensures an empty universe cannot spontaneously ascend scales. | ✅ PASS | OK, passed 100 tests . |
